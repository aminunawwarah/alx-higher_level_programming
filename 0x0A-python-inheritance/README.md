# Python - Inheritance

Like other object-oriented programming languages, Python supports inheritance.
A class can be inherited and all the features it has will become available to 
the classes that inherited from it. The class the is inherited from is called
the superclass while the classes that inherited from the superclass are called
subclasses.
