# Python - Input/Output

Input/output or I/O is one of the main jobs of every programming language.
In other words, every programming language has a way of accepting input
and giving out output. Python is no exception. Input can be from one of the
computer input devices such as the keyboard or from a file i.e the content of
a file is read as the input. On the other hand, output can be to one of the
computer output devices such as the screen or to a file i.e the output is 
written to a file. File output is important because the output may be used
when the program is not running. This is unlike variables because there 
content is lost when the program is no longer running.
