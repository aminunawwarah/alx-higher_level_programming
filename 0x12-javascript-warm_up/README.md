0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
==========================
This project contains introduction to JavaScript programming. JavaScript is another interpreted language. Unlike C, it is a dynamic language.

Though, by it's name 'JavaScript', it has nothing to do with the Java language. This means that JavaScript and Java are two separate and different languages althogh they share some common syntax.
